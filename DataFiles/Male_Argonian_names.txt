Obtaining a Cyrodilic (Tamrielic) name for an Argonian may vary between individuals. Sometimes
the Cyrodilic name is a direct translation of their Jel name.[4][5] While in other cases the Cyrodilic name appears to have no apparent connection to the Jel name. It is possible that the Cyrodilic name may be used preferentially when the Argonian's Jel name is considered unpronounceable by some non-Argonians.
